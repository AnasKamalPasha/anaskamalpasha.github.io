I like to keep an elevator pitch for everything. I believe, whenever i have given substance and background to any activity or conversation, the result always has been fruitful for me. 

<br>
I am a marketing and management student from the [Institute of Business Management (IoBM)](https://www.iobm.edu.pk/) and i am seeking a management trainee position in marketing. 

<br>
I had won the national marketing competition 2019 held by the Indus Motor company last year by providing substance in the world vehicle safety. I have also executed an on ground project worth PKR 2 Million for IMC as a by product of winning that competition. I also successfully launched the first student operated food venture brand at IoBM by the name of "Brinj" and i am also the founder of my own education technology based start up by the name of Class Mate.

<br>
I am currently in my senior year, majoring in Marketing at IoBM and i am looking for an opportunity as a brand manager.

<br>
When i am not looking to get employed, i usually scour the internet for news
