I grew up being fascinated by the technology around me. After I got my first arduino, I would spend hours trying to understand C. I had alot of fun doing that and decided that Engineering/ Software is where I want to be.

### Projects

* [Drowsy Detector](https://github.com/ShayanRiyaz/Drowsy-Detector)<br>
A drowsy detector for drivers on long trips. If the camera detects drowsiness it quickly alerts the user and suggests rest stops or gas stations opening nearby.


### Coming Soon
